title: RUMI – Photogrammetry Pipeline
description: Automated pipeline turning ROV footage into geo-positioned 3D worlds.
longDescription: |
  Photogrammetry converts overlapping images into accurate 3D meshes.  
  We applied the technique to raw footage from ROV **Hercules**, then wrapped
  the workflow in a set of Python + C++ tools that ingest a dive’s data and
  output an optimised, geo-referenced environment ready for Unreal Engine.

  The pipeline now runs unattended after every expedition, providing fresh
  digital mapping for scientists and for the RUMI Simulator.
