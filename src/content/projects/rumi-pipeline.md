title: RUMI â€“ Photogrammetry Pipeline
description: Photogrammetry is a method of 3D model creation using images or videos. We applied this technique to underwater footage captured by ROV Hercules to construct accurate geo-positioned digital environments of the seafloor. This process was later refined into a suite of tools to automatically process a dive's data into a digital world.
