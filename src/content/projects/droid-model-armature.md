title: Droideka Armature
description: Commissioned Blender rig featuring IK + Bézier-driven 360° animations.
longDescription: |
  Commissioned to build a **fully-rigged Droideka (Star Wars) skeleton** for a
  game mod.  The armature combines inverse kinematics with Bézier-curve controls
  to drive fluid, procedurally generated 360-degree roll and transform
  animations.

  Delivered as a clean, game-ready Blender file with documented control bones,
  making it easy for animators to create new moves without breaking the rig.
