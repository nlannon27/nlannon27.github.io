title: Sandbox Cellular Automata
description: Cellular Automata written in C++ using the SFML OpenGL library. Created using classes with polymorphism to allow for easy editing and creation of new elements. In the future I plan to optimize more by implementing a chunk based system like quadtrees or spatial hash grids. This would allow me to create more complicated elements or use a bigger grid.
