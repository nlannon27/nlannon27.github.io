title: Sandbox Cellular Automata
description: A C++/SFML sandbox for falling-sand–style cellular automata.
longDescription: |
  Written in modern C++ with **SFML** and OpenGL. Elements are implemented as
  polymorphic classes, making it trivial to add new behaviours without touching
  the simulation core.

  Next steps include spatial partitioning (quad-trees or spatial hash grids) to
  support larger worlds and more complex element interactions.
