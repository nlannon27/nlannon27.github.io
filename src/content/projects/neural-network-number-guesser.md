title: Neural Network Number Guesser
description: Java + Spring GUI demo that recognises MNIST digits (~70 % accuracy).
longDescription: |
  A fully custom neural-network library written from scratch in Java. The GUI
  is rendered with **Java Spring**, while all maths and back-prop logic are my
  own code. Accuracy can be improved with further training or enhanced
  preprocessing.
