description: Immersive UE-5 dive simulator used aboard E/V *Nautilus* expeditions.
longDescription: |
  The **Realtime Underwater Modeling & Immersion (RUMI) Simulator** recreates
  real dives inside Unreal Engine 5. Students and researchers can replay a dive
  exactly as it happened, explore the reconstructed seafloor, and practise
  ROV piloting in VR.

  Built with C++ gameplay systems and connected to a Python data-prep pipeline,
  RUMI synchronises video, sensor streams, and photogrammetry assets at runtime
  for a faithful, interactive experience.
