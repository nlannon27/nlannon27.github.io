title: Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
description: Interactive JS tool that animates and times classic sorting algorithms.
longDescription: |
  A web app (HTML + CSS + JavaScript) built for a class project to **compare
  runtime characteristics of different sorting algorithms**.

  * Choose tick-rate, array size, and algorithm (Bubble, Insertion, Merge,
    Quick …).
  * Bars animate **both** cell movements *and* element comparisons, requiring
    custom tweaks to each algorithm’s inner loop.
  * Displays elapsed time and comparison count when finished.

  The biggest challenge was balancing animation clarity with algorithm
  correctness while keeping the UI reactive to large input sizes.
