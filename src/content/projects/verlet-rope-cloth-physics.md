title: Verlet Rope & Cloth Physics
description: An expansion I made for my Molecular Physics Engine. This update makes it possible to chain together objects with bonds into ropes and cloth. I also optimized the code by using grid collision detection. Every object is stored within a grid cell, and now will only check collisions with neighboring cells instead of every other object.
